# Resume Classifier


Resumes exemplify unstructured data. With no universally accepted format, each resume features its own unique style, text blocks, and category titles. Extracting and classifying text from resumes is challenging due to the vast variety of possible layouts.
In this project we will be making use of NLP techniques to extract data from resumes and classify them


1.⁠ ⁠The basic data analysis process performed such as data collection, text mining, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization.

2.⁠ ⁠Building a Machine learning model for Resume Classification using Python and basic Natural language processing techniques. 

3.⁠ ⁠Used Python's libraries to implement various NLP techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, parts of speech tagging, etc.

4.⁠ ⁠A resume classification analyzes resume data and extracts the information into the machine-readable output. It helps automatically store, organize, and analyze the resume data to find out the candidate for the particular job position and requirements.

5.⁠ ⁠The aim of this project is achieved by performing the various data analysis methods and using the Machine Learning models and Natural Language Processing which will help in classifying the categories of the resume and building the Resume Classification Model.


All models above show the following train and test accuracy:

Further I have deployed this model with the help of streamlit, in my web app users can upload multiple resumes and the model will classify them into 4 segments:
1.⁠ ⁠PeopleSoft
2.⁠ ⁠React JS Developer
3.⁠ ⁠SDE
4.⁠ ⁠Data Science

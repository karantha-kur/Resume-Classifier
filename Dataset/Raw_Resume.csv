PROJECT:



Title	:Density based Traffic Control System USING ARDUINO.



Duration:4 months.



Description: Traffic congestion is a severe problem in most of the cities across the world and it has become a nightmare for the citizens. It is caused by delay in signal, inappropriate timing of traffic signalling etc. The delay of traffic light is hard coded and it does not depend on traffic. Therefore, for optimising traffic control, there is an increasing demand in systematic quick automatic system. This project is designed to develop a density based dynamic traffic signal control. The signal timing changes automatically on sensing the traffic density at the junction. The microcontroller used in this project is ARDUINO. The system contains IR sensors & ultrasonic sensors (transmitter and receiver) which will be mounted on the either side of the road on poles. It gets activated and receives the signal as the vehicles passes close by it.

Working Papers



Democratic Repression: Responding in Kind?



In this paper I use webscraped events data (SPEED Project) to analyze the dynamic relationship between public dissent and state repression. Using a series of random effects logit models I find that democracies typically respond to dissent with an equivalent use of force.



Terrorism and Spanish Elections: Does Terrorism Impact Support for the Central Government?



In this paper I use Spanish polling data to assess the impact of terrorism in Spain on support for the two major political parties. Using time series models (ADL and GECM) I find that only particularly catastrophic events influence public opinion, while average terrorism has no effect.

PERSONAL PROFILE 

As a recent graduate with a first class honours Masters in Mathematics, I have experience in mathematical modelling, and am skilled in statistics, problem solving, statistical modelling, and programming. I am motivated to apply my mathematical knowledge to real world data-related scenarios- with my fourth-year project aiming to provide insight into multiple sclerosis (MS). High levels of diligence and resilience have enabled me to work successfully, both independently and in diverse teams. Excellent communication skills and a strong work ethic have allowed me to form and maintain professional relationships, resulting in me returning to the same employer for two consecutive summers.  

EDUCATION 

First Class Masters of Mathematics (MMath) degree at University of Exeter (2016 – 2020) 

 

Averaged 77% in Mathematics degree (first class honours). 

Areas of study included: Machine Learning (99%), Computational Nonlinear Dynamics (96%), Numerics and Optimisation (87%), Statistics (80%), Statistical Modelling (69%), Mathematical 

Theory of Option Pricing (86%), Statistical Modelling in Space and Time (76%) 

Oxted School, Surrey (2009 – 2016) 

 

AAA at A level in Physics, Mathematics and Further Mathematics

8 A*s and 3 As at GCSE 

 

PROJECTS 

Final year research project: Bifurcation analysis of oscillations in a self-coupled neuron with delay – computationally modelling the effects of demyelination on electrical excitability in neurons- for insight into diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The MATLAB model was compared to experimental data. I collaborated with international academics and published a peer-reviewed paper ‘Robust spike timing in an excitable cell with delayed feedback’ in The Journal of the Royal Society Interface.  

Various machine learning projects – Achieved a mark of 99 for machine learning projects in Python, where I compared the performance of reinforcement learning methods at solving grid world games, implemented a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) and compared the performance of ensemble methods on classifying images of hand-written digits. 

Computationally modelling nonlinear dynamics– Achieved marks of 97 and 95 for projects investigating and modelling pendulum dynamics and oscillatory behaviours in excitable neurons in MATLAB. 

SKILLS 

			• 	Advanced knowledge of MATLAB 

• 	Intermediate knowledge of Python (sklearn, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, pandas), Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and LaTeX 

Basic knowledge of R and SQL 

Teamwork, time management, customer service, problem solving, and presenting 

WORK EXPERIENCE 

Accounts Assistant at TClarke (Summer 2018 & 2019)

Enhancing Satellite Image Height Estimation via Fusing Street-view Depth

Oct, 2021 - Present

Master Research Project







	Problem: Estimating height from single-view satellite image is highly ill-posed. Existing methods that rely on only image color or texture cannot solve this problem at its root since no explicit contextual clues are included.



	Contribution: Proposed a novel framework which fuses contextual information from street-view images like occlusion and perspective into height estimation. As a result, this method improves accuracy by 10∼20%.





Cropland Extraction from UAV Imagery via Superpixel Segmentation Bachelor Research Project




Oct, 2019 - Apr, 2020





	Problem: Pixel-level image segmentation algorithms usually face slow training speed and over-segmentation. Extracting cropland at pixel level may cause inconsistent results due to its irregular shape and ambiguous edge.



	Contribution: Different from end-to-end segmentation, I propose a strategy of superpixel segmentation first and then classification, which speeds up training, reduces misclassification and produces more consistent results.
